"""Piper TTS wrapper with streaming-text input, mid-playback cancellation,
and an amplitude-envelope hook for the (future) overlay orb.

Implements TextToSpeech (audio/protocols.py) and Loadable (core/lifecycle.py).

Streaming text input
--------------------
The TextToSpeech protocol exposes speak(text: str). PiperTTS additionally
provides speak_stream(text_chunks: AsyncIterator[str]) for the Phase 3
LLM-token-streaming case. speak_stream buffers chunks and emits to
synthesis on a sentence boundary OR after `max_wait_seconds` (default
0.8 s) of no new text, whichever comes first. Rationale:

  - Sentence boundary detection means natural prosody and perceived
    responsiveness (Jarvis starts talking after the first sentence
    instead of waiting for the full response).
  - The max-wait fallback prevents the final incomplete sentence from
    stalling forever when the producer simply ends without trailing
    punctuation.
  - 0.8 s is the UX compromise: long enough that the LLM can finish a
    short clause; short enough that the listener doesn't experience a
    perceptible pause before the tail of a response.

Cancellation contract
---------------------
cancel() must abort playback within the duration of the current audio
write -- it is the load-bearing barge-in path. If the user starts
speaking and TTS keeps playing for another sentence, the experience
collapses.

Implementation:
  - threading.Event (_cancel_event) signals the synthesis thread.
  - sounddevice OutputStream.abort() is the actual stop -- NOT stop(),
    which waits for the buffer to drain. abort() drops buffered samples
    immediately.
  - The synthesis loop in _sync_speak checks _cancel_event between audio
    chunks AND catches the exception that stream.write() raises after
    abort, returning cleanly either way.
  - cancel() returns once the stream has been aborted and the event is
    set; the thread executor for in-flight speak() will exit on its
    next chunk boundary.

Amplitude envelope hook (for future overlay orb)
-------------------------------------------------
Constructor accepts an optional `on_amplitude: Callable[[float], None]`
callback. When set, _sync_speak computes per-window RMS amplitude
normalized to [0,1] at ~30 Hz (one window per ~33 ms of output audio)
and calls the callback. The callback is invoked from the synthesis
thread; the consumer is responsible for any thread bridging it needs
(Qt signals, asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe, etc.).

Why a callback rather than a bus event:
  - High frequency (~30 Hz). Going through bus dispatch adds overhead
    and ordering races for what is essentially per-frame UI data.
  - Avoids adding a new event type to events.py for a UI-only signal.
  - Phase 5's overlay can wrap this in whatever Qt-thread bridge it
    needs without coupling the TTS layer to PySide6.

Threading
---------
Same discipline as STT. Synthesis is CPU-bound (typical 100-300 ms per
sentence on the medium voice). speak() runs synthesis + playback inside
asyncio.to_thread so the loop stays free for barge-in detection. Stream
abort() is also wrapped in to_thread defensively.

Model files
-----------
Piper voices are two files: `<voice>.onnx` and `<voice>.onnx.json`.
Smaller than whisper (~60 MB for a medium voice), so bundling in the
installer is straightforward.

In production (post-Phase-7) the installer pre-places voice files into
a known directory and passes `voices_dir`. For development, place the
files manually or use the piper-tts CLI to download them. The wrapper
does NOT auto-download.
