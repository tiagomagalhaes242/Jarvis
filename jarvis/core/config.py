"""Jarvis configuration: pydantic v2 schema, JSON persistence, migration hook.

Design notes (kept here so future readers see the rationale without digging history):

- Path is injected (load_config(path) / save_config(cfg, path)). The default lives
  in `default_config_path()`; OS-specific helpers will move to `platform/` once
  that layer exists. Until then, the one branch here is contained.
- `extra="forbid"` rejects unknown keys to catch typos in hand-edited JSON.
  Migrations must explicitly drop removed fields.
- `validate_assignment=True` makes bad UI writes fail at the assignment site
  rather than at next save.
- Save is atomic: write tmp, replace.
- Secrets (research API keys, MCP auth tokens) are encrypted at rest with
  Windows DPAPI. Encryption is a *persistence-boundary* concern: `save_config`
  encrypts on the way out and `load_config` decrypts on the way in, so the
  in-memory `JarvisConfig` always holds plaintext and every consumer
  (Settings UI, deep-research runner, MCP client) is unchanged. See
  `jarvis/platform/secrets.py` for the storage format and the documented
  non-Windows plaintext fallback. `_SECRET_FIELD_PATHS` below is the single
  list of what counts as a secret — add to it, not to individual call sites.
- Migrations are a chain of v(N) -> v(N+1) functions, applied in sequence.
  Today there is only one schema version, so MIGRATIONS is empty; the comment
  in MIGRATIONS is the template for adding the first real migration.
- This module deliberately does not depend on `events.py`. ConfigChanged events
  are the responsibility of a future `ConfigManager` wrapper (Phase 5-ish)
  which will own (JarvisConfig, EventBus), expose set(path, value), compute
  the diff, and emit. Decision: chokepoint emission rather than emit-from-UI
  so any future caller (first-launch flow, migration completion, test
  fixtures) gets the event for free.
