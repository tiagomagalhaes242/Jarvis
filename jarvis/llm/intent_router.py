"""Hybrid intent router: pattern layer for snap commands, LLM for the rest.

Two layers
----------
1. Pattern layer (deterministic, fast, no LLM call). First-match-wins
   table of (regex, intent_builder) tuples applied to the user's
   transcription after filler-word stripping. Misses fall through to
   the LLM. SPEC: this is what makes Jarvis feel snappy -- "open
   spotify" should never wait for a 7B-parameter model.

2. LLM layer. The transcription is added to the conversation history,
   OllamaClient.stream_chat() is invoked, and the model's text is
   buffered for the duration of one round (see "Double-speaking"
   below). Tool calls arrive batched on the final chunk; the
   accumulation point below is defensive against Ollama later
   streaming them per-chunk.

Tool-result feedback loop
-------------------------
The standard OpenAI/Ollama round trip, so the model can act on what a
tool returned instead of dispatching blind:

  1. Model returns tool_calls.
  2. The router executes them through the registry.
  3. Conversation records ONE assistant message carrying those
     tool_calls plus one role:"tool" message per call, correlated by
     tool_call_id (Conversation.add_tool_round_trip).
  4. The model is re-invoked with that history.
  5. Repeat until it returns no tool calls, bounded by
     max_tool_iterations (default 3 -- latency on a local 7B is the
     binding constraint, not correctness).

Hitting the bound is not an error path that hangs or loops: the final
round's tool results are spoken directly, so the user always hears
something.

The loop needs a registry (you cannot observe a result you cannot
execute). Without one -- or with max_tool_iterations == 1 -- the
router falls back to the legacy one-shot behaviour: yield ToolIntents
and let the caller execute and speak them. That fallback is also the
config escape hatch for anyone who prefers a tool's own polished
output over the model's paraphrase of it.

Double-speaking
---------------
Text is buffered for the whole of each round rather than yielded per
chunk, because tool calls arrive last: speaking narration as it
streams and only then discovering a tool call would produce
"Opening Chrome..." followed by the tool's own "Opening Chrome". So a
round that ends in tool calls speaks nothing -- neither the narration
nor the raw tool result -- and the model's next round, which has seen
the results, is the single utterance the user hears. Only the
bound-exhausted path speaks a raw tool result, and only because there
is no further model round to summarise it.

Streaming contract with the pipeline
------------------------------------
route() is an async generator yielding Intent values. The pipeline
(Phase 4 wiring) collects consecutive SpeakIntents into a queue feeding
PiperTTS.speak_stream() so token-level chunks get sentence-segmented
inside TTS rather than firing one synthesis per token. ToolIntents
break the speak run cleanly (end-of-stream sentinel + speak_task
completion + tool execution). See the Phase 3 design note for the
dispatch pattern.

Cancellation
------------
The async generator propagates CancelledError up through
ollama_client.stream_chat() into the httpx stream's context manager
(verified by ollama_client tests). add_assistant_turn() is outside any
try/except, so a cancelled stream simply never reaches it -- partial
assistant text never enters conversation history.

The feedback loop preserves that property by construction. Every await
inside a round -- the stream, and each registry.execute() -- happens
BEFORE anything is written to history; the assistant tool_calls
message and its role:"tool" results are appended together in one
synchronous call with no await between them, so a cancel can land
before the round trip or after it, never inside it.

Deliberate tradeoffs (documented at point of choice)
----------------------------------------------------
- User turn IS preserved on cancellation. The user said it, that's
  fact. Two consecutive user turns with no assistant between is
  technically malformed history (most chat APIs assume strict
  alternation), but tracking "did this turn get a response?" adds
  state that's not worth Phase 3's complexity. Future-polish knob if
  the malformed shape causes observable model-quality issues.

- Tool execution is sequential after a SpeakIntent run completes.
  No mid-sentence tool firing in the current implementation: a stream
  of Speak("foo ") -> Speak("bar") -> Tool(...) drains the speak run
  fully before the tool fires. The architecture supports interleaving
  (ToolIntent breaks the speak run via the pipeline's queue sentinel)
  but the current router doesn't decompose responses to make use of
  it. Acceptable for v1; revisit if a UX win emerges from interleaving.

    The table used to be a hand-ordered literal here; the regexes now live
    on the tool classes they dispatch to, as `voice_patterns` class
    attributes (see `jarvis.tools.registry.VoicePattern`), and are
    collected by `jarvis.tools.catalogue.voice_pattern_catalogue()`.

    ORDERING IS BEHAVIOUR. The layer is first-match-wins, so the position
    of a pattern decides which tool wins an utterance two patterns could
    both match. Order therefore comes from each pattern's explicit integer
    `priority` (lower runs first) and from nothing else — not declaration
    order, not catalogue order, and above all not registration order. The
    canonical example: `open_app`'s `^open\s+(.+)$` carries
    PRIORITY_CATCH_ALL so "open my notes", "open the dashboard", "open
    logs", "open my workspace", "open clipboard history" and "open help"
    are each claimed by their own tool first. `tests/llm/
    test_router_pattern_equivalence.py` pins the assembled order against a
    golden captured before this refactor.

    The two time patterns below are the only router-native entries left:
    they answer locally with a SpeakIntent and have no tool to hang off.
    They are merged into the same priority-sorted sequence rather than
    being special-cased at the front, so their precedence is stated the
    same way every other pattern's is.

    The catalogue import is function-local (the same idiom as
    `jarvis.tools.setup_local_tools`) so importing the router does not pull
    in every tool module; this runs once per IntentRouter construction.
