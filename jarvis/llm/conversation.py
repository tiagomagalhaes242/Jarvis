"""In-memory conversation state for the Jarvis chat loop.

Maintains turn history as message dicts in OpenAI/Ollama format
([{"role": "user"|"assistant", "content": str}, ...]). Trims to
max_turns (system prompt always preserved at index 0). Clears after
inactivity_timeout_seconds of idle on the next user turn.

Not a Loadable -- pure in-memory state, no resources.

Wake-word activation policy
---------------------------
maybe_clear(continuity_seconds) is wired by the composition root to
AudioPipeline's on_wake hook. It uses a time-windowed rule:

- If elapsed_since_last_assistant_turn <= continuity_seconds: keep
  history — the user is following up ("yes", "the sorcerer part", etc.)
- If elapsed_since_last_assistant_turn > continuity_seconds: wipe —
  a new session has begun and stale tool-call context would bias the LLM.

Default continuity_seconds = 60 (cfg.llm.conversation_continuity_seconds).
Trade-offs: 10 s — aggressive follow-ups don't link; 300 s — cross-task
contamination risk returns; 60 s — matches typical conversational tempo.

System prompt sourcing
----------------------
The constructor takes a `system_prompt_provider: Callable[[], str]`
called on every current_messages() (and therefore every add_user_turn,
which returns the message list). This means edits to LLMConfig's
system_prompt take effect on the very next user message without a
restart and without any ConfigChanged subscription -- the conversation
just always reads the live value.

Picked over the alternative (subscribe to ConfigChanged and update
a stored prompt) because:
  - Zero synchronization risk; no stale-cache window.
  - One function call per turn cost; negligible.
  - Conversation stays event-system-free (matches the Phase 1 layering
    decision that core.config also has no events.py dependency).

The composition root passes `lambda: cfg.llm.system_prompt`.

Inactivity policy
-----------------
last_activity is updated by BOTH add_user_turn and add_assistant_turn.
If only the user turn updated it, a slow LLM response (e.g., 30 s on
a fresh model load) followed by a follow-up user turn would falsely
clear the history. Resetting on assistant turn too keeps the
conversation alive across the full request/response cycle.

Tool round trips (the feedback loop)
------------------------------------
add_tool_round_trip() records the OpenAI/Ollama tool-calling shape:
one assistant message carrying `tool_calls`, immediately followed by
one `role: "tool"` message per call, each keyed by `tool_call_id`.
That is what lets the model SEE what a tool returned and act on it
("what's the weather, and if it's below 10 open my coat app").

Why role:"tool" and not an assistant turn. An earlier revision stored
tool result strings as ASSISTANT turns; the model read them as things
it had said and re-fired the same tool on unrelated follow-ups. The
fix at the time was to drop tool results entirely (see the removed
role:"tool" filter). Storing them under their own role with the call
id that produced them is the shape the protocol actually defines --
the model reads it as "a tool I already called and already have an
answer for", which is precisely the framing the old bug lacked.

Orphaning is the hazard this file has to handle. A round trip adds
1 + N messages at once, so trimming to max_turns can decapitate one:
cut the assistant message and the role:"tool" messages that referenced
it are left dangling. Chat APIs (Ollama included) reject a tool
message with no parent tool_call_id, and reject an assistant tool_calls
message whose results never arrived. Two layers defend against it:

  1. _trim() extends its cut forward over any role:"tool" message that
     would be left without its parent (write time).
  2. _filter_turns_for_llm() drops both halves of a broken pair
     (read time) -- covering hand-built history and the mid-flight
     state left by a turn cancelled between the assistant tool_calls
     message and its results.
