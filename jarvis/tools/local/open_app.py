"""Launch a desktop application by name with fuzzy matching.

Resolution order (most reliable first):
  1. Fuzzy match against installed apps (Start Menu + App Paths) on the
     spoken token — yields a real .lnk / .exe path, which launches
     reliably. This comes FIRST because a bare name (steps 2/4) is only
     as good as what Windows can resolve for it, so a per-user install
     like Spotify or Discord may not open at all.
  2. Alias table (chrome -> chrome, vscode -> code, …): the alias is a
     normalization hint. We re-resolve the canonical token against the
     installed index, then fall back to the bare command for
     App-Paths / PATH resolution.
  3. Direct path launch if the token is an existing file.
  4. Pass-through to Windows shell resolution (App Paths / PATH / file
     associations). This is the one candidate built from raw, untrusted
     text, so jarvis.platform.windows rejects it if it carries shell
     metacharacters; the tool reports that like any other launch failure.
