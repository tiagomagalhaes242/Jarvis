"""Vision tool — capture the screen, ship it to a multimodal Ollama model,
speak the description back.

Pipeline
--------
1. Grab the primary display via pyautogui (same library as ScreenshotTool;
   late-imported because it pulls in mouse/keyboard hooks).
2. Resize to the configured long-edge cap (default 1280 px) with Pillow.
   Vision models do their own internal downscale; this cap just keeps the
   HTTP payload small and the prompt-eval time bounded.
3. Encode PNG → base64.
4. POST to Ollama's /api/chat with the vision model and the user's
   question (defaults to a generic "describe the screen" prompt).
5. Save the captured PNG to the user's screenshots folder so they have a
   reference for what Jarvis was looking at, then return the model's
   response as the spoken output.

Why a separate tool, not just adding images to the main LLM
----------------------------------------------------------
Vision-capable Ollama models (llava, moondream, minicpm-v, qwen2.5-vl)
are different from the conversational text model (`llm.model`). Letting
the main router pass images to qwen2.5:7b-instruct fails opaquely inside
Ollama. Exposing a dedicated `see_screen` tool with its own model
(VisionConfig.model) makes the swap explicit and gracefully degrades
when no vision model is pulled."""
