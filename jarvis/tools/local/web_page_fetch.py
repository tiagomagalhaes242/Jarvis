"""Fetch a web page and extract clean readable text (no JS).

Used by deep research to give the worker LLM full article text instead of
short DDG snippets. Pure-stdlib + httpx; no headless browser, so very fast
but skips JS-heavy sites (acceptable trade-off for local research).

The URLs handled here come from search-engine results or from the LLM, i.e.
they are influenced by third parties. Two guards follow from that:

* responses are streamed under a byte budget so a huge (hostile or merely
  broken) body cannot exhaust memory, and
* destinations that resolve to loopback / private / link-local addresses are
  refused, so the research fetcher cannot be pointed at services on the
  user's own machine or LAN (Ollama on 127.0.0.1:11434, a router admin page,
  a NAS…). Jarvis is a desktop app rather than a server, so this is a
  smaller problem than a classic server-side SSRF — but a research fetcher
  still has no business reaching the private network.
