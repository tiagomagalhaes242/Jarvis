"""Tool protocol and registry — the single namespace through which the LLM
discovers callable tools and through which the router executes them.

Local tools (jarvis/tools/local/*.py) register at composition time; MCP-
adapted tools register lazily via jarvis/tools/mcp_client.py as remote
servers come online. All tools satisfy the same Tool protocol; the
registry does not distinguish local from remote.

Design rationale (Phase 4 Task 1 design note, approved):

- Validation lives at the registry boundary. Tools see an already-
  validated pydantic BaseModel via execute(). Bad raw args surface as
  ToolResult(success=False, error=...), never as exceptions, so the
  router can speak the failure back without try/except plumbing.

- Name collisions raise ToolNameCollisionError. Built-in tools register first
  at startup so they always win; MCP wrappers catch the exception and
  drop the colliding tool from the offending server only. No silent
  overwrites — a clobber on a tool the LLM trusts is a footgun.

- list_enabled() is the source of truth for visibility. as_openai_
  functions() filters through it; execute() re-checks it fresh per call.
  A config edit between the LLM choosing a tool and execute() dispatching
  it must drop the call cleanly rather than race-execute the disabled
  tool. Tested explicitly.

- requires_confirmation IS wired, and execute() is where it is
  enforced. Every tool call — pattern-routed, LLM-chosen via
  IntentRouter._run_tools, or command-palette — funnels through
  execute(), so gating it there gates all of them; there is no second
  dispatch path a caller could reach around.

  The UX is a modal Qt dialog (jarvis/ui/tool_confirm.py), NOT the
  cancel-window or voice-confirmation designs this was originally
  deferred for. Both of those needed the audio path: the cancel window
  needs barge-in (still disabled by speaker → mic feedback) and voice
  confirmation needs STT during TTS. A dialog on the Qt main thread
  needs neither, so the blocker does not apply to it. The audio thread
  awaits the verdict; the bridge is described in ui/tool_confirm.py.

  The gate FAILS CLOSED. A registry built without a confirmer — every
  headless test, and the window before the Qt UI exists — denies any
  tool that asks for confirmation rather than running it unguarded. A
  denial is a ToolResult(success=False, error=...) like every other
  failure mode here, never an exception: the router speaks it back and
  the model can read it and choose differently.

  Tools opt in individually. Today that is type_into_active_window
  (synthesises arbitrary keystrokes into whatever window has focus —
  a terminal, an address bar, a password field) and any MCP tool whose
  server config sets requires_confirmation. See the note on
  lock_screen for a tool that was considered and deliberately left
  ungated.

- MCP tool name sanitisation lives in mcp_client.py (Task 3). The
  shared TOOL_NAME_REGEX below is the validity contract: lowercase
  alphanumerics, underscore, hyphen; 1–64 chars. Dots get replaced with
  underscores at adapter time (fs.read_file -> fs_read_file) because the
  Ollama/OpenAI function-name surface forbids them.

    Two of the members are shaped by what the registry does with them
    rather than by what reads most naturally here:

    - `args_schema` is a read-only property, not a mutable attribute. A
      mutable protocol attribute is invariant, which would reject every
      tool in the tree: they all declare their own model
      (``args_schema = OpenUrlArgs``), and ``type[OpenUrlArgs]`` is not
      the same type as ``type[BaseModel]``. Nothing assigns through the
      protocol — registry.execute() only reads it — so read-only is the
      accurate declaration, and it makes the member covariant.

    - `execute` is generic in its argument. Implementations narrow the
      parameter to their own model, which is unsound in general but is
      exactly the invariant ToolRegistry.execute() enforces: it
      validates the raw args through *that tool's* `args_schema` and
      hands the result straight to `execute`, so a tool can only ever
      be called with an instance of its own model. Parameterising the
